# 2025

For this year, as I am overseas and attempting the challenges without fixed schedule or discipline, I will not be taking time or attempting fast solves.

### Day 1
I thought there would be an optimised route for 1-2 using modulo and floor division, but I meddled with it for too long and decided it was not worth the effort.
### Day 2
Slightly more challenging than day 1, although it took less time. 2-2 was made much easier by use of functions.
### Day 3
2 digit numbers were easy to handle for part 1, for part 2 I had to be a little more creative and search from the right towards the left.
### Day 4
A classic AOC problem involving 2D maps, easy to figure out the surrounding 8 blocks. For part 2, added another loop and deleted rolls as we went.
### Day 5
This one messed with me as I initially kept the integer ranges in a dictionary. No idea why, but using a list was better as identical lower bounds create new ranges regardless, rather than overriding. Part 2 was straightforward as I just had to simplify the ranges and do a little math.
