# 2025

For this year, as I am overseas and attempting the challenges without fixed schedule or discipline, I will not be taking time or attempting fast solves.

### 1-1, 1-2
I thought there would be an optimised route for 1-2 using modulo and floor division, but I meddled with it for too long and decided it was not worth the effort
### 2-1, 2-2
Slightly more challenging than day 1, although it took less time. 2-2 was made much easier by use of functions.
