# Advent-Of-Code 2023

This repository contains my (unoptimised, messy) solutions to the Advent Of Code 2023 by Eric Wastl.

The website can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/)

My goal with my solutions is not to necessarily have the most optimised answer, but rather to come up with something that works. I am taking this to challenge my problem solving and programming abilities rather than looking to maximise absolute performance.
