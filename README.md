# Advent-Of-Code

This repository contains my (unoptimised, messy) solutions to the Advent Of Code by Eric Wastl.

The website can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repository is structured as such as I may complete more years of AOC.

My reflections for each year can be found in their respective folders.
